# Extra exercise
# 1. Read two variables, number1 and number2, of type float, from the user.
# 2. Read a variable operation that can be "+", "-", "*", or "/". If "stop" is entered, the program stops.
# 3. Using if, elif, and else, perform the requested operation between number1 and number2 and display the result.
# 4. If the operation is invalid, stop the program.
# 5. Use a while loop to repeat the steps above until the user enters "stop".


# 1. Numbers from 1 to 10
# Write a program that displays all the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.


# 2. Even numbers between 1 and 20
# Write a program that displays all the even numbers between 1 and 20 using a while loop.


# 3. Sum of the first 10 integers
# Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of the first 10 integers (from 1 to 10 inclusive) using a for loop.


# 4. Countdown
# Write a program that displays a countdown from 10 to 1 using a while loop.


# 5. Odd numbers between 1 and 15
# Write a program that displays all the odd numbers between 1 and 15. Use a for loop and an if condition.


# 6. Check if a number is positive
# Write a program that reads an integer from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.
# Display an appropriate message.


# 7. Digits of a number
# Write a program that reads an integer from the user and displays each digit of the number on a new line.
# Use a while loop to extract the digits.


# 8. Numbers divisible by 3 between 1 and 30
# Write a program that displays all numbers between 1 and 30 that are divisible by 3. Use a for loop and the modulo operator (%).


# 9. Display the squares of numbers from 1 to 10
# Write a program that displays the square of each number from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# Display the results in the format "Number: Square".


# 10. Average of entered numbers
# Write a program that reads 5 integers from the user and calculates their average.
# Use a for loop to read and add the numbers, then divide the sum by 5 to get the average.
